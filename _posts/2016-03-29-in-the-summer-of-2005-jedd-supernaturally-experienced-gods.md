description: "In the summer of 2005, Jedd supernaturally experienced God's love for Colombia and the Colombian people. This love - along with multiple dreams, visions, and prophetic words - compelled Jedd to travel with his friend and pastor Carlos Rodríguez to Medellín in November of 2014. The moment his feet hit the dirt, his heart confirmed what his spirit already knew - this is his home. Upon his return to the United States, Jedd relinquished his stake in his printing company, returned to the School of Revival full-time, and begun preparations for his permanent relocation. Jedd has since met the love of his life Mary in Medellín, and he couldn't be happier. ♥"
